new_test.py is a program incorporating object-oriented and functional programming aspects. An original source code file (unedited) and an edited source code file that imitates malicious code inserted (or deleted code) are required for this program to work properly and show its use.

robot.py incorporates the use of the pygame module as well as using keystroke and voice commands to guide a robot. The image robot.png_small is needed for this program to work properly. Addditionally, a .txt will be created for logging purposes.
