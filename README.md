state_database.py is a simple program that uses a dictionary to store and pass various data about U.S. states including the capital, population, and the state flower.

**NEW** Data Analysis: This folder contains Python files created for the purpose of data analysis, generating predictive models, and applying machine learning concepts. Each .py file has .csv file(s) associated with it. Please refer to the source code to associate the correct data. The path used in the source code represents the path for running the program in Google collab and may need to be edited for your specific environment.

Personal Projects:

new_test.py is a program incorporating object-oriented and functional programming aspects. An original source code file (unedited) and an edited source code file that imitates malicious code inserted (or deleted code) are required for this program to work properly and show its use.

The Robot Control program incorporates the use of the pygame module as well as using keystroke and voice commands to guide a robot. The image robot.png_small is needed for this program to work properly.

stock_predictor.py incorporates machine learning modules to track and predict stock prices. The program pulls data from Yahoo Finance and display's an actual and predicted trend to the user. Additionally, this program finds the best hyperparameters to use for predicition purposes. Note that this program is still under development.
