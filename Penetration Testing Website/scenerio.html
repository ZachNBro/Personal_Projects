                    You are part of the security team at a small software company called Software-R-Us. Your
                    company stores and manages customer data for a larger software company. Software-R-Us has recently
                    deployed their data management system which includes a login application for its employees. Each
                    employee has been granted specific permissions based on their position within the company.
                    However, after deploying the application, someone has apparently gained access to an admin's account
                    and began wreaking havoc on the data being managed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the company's newely appointed security expert, you are to review the login application's code
                    and find out how and why the malicious user was able to gain access to and manipulate the data.
