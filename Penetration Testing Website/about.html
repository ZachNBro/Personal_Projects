                         Access Control: Limits what actions can be performed after the authentication phase of a
                         credential-checking procedure.

                         Access Control is an exceptionally import part of an application or program, especially
                         when we are dealing with vast amounts of sensitive data such as employee and customer PII.
                         Two aspects of access control involve the initial Authentication process followed by the
                         Authorization process. We start with authentication; using strong passwords and two-factor
                         authentication methods. We follow with proper authorization; granting appropriate permissions
                         to those users who are authenticated. These are known as Access Levels.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         Without proper access levels, malicious users may be able to bypass safety mechanisms and gain
                         unauthorized access to a system including its resources and data. For this pen-testing
                         procedure, we will delve into a situation where hightened access has been granted to a
                         malicious user. It is up to you to decide how to mitigate it based on the information learned.
